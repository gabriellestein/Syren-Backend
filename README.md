# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thank you to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README
Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

# Syren Back End

## Description
ETL pipeline that makes specialized calls to Google Maps API to get specific emergency resources.

## Endpoints
### /
This is the main endpoint for the API. It displays the location data currently stored in the GCP bucket.

### /manual
This manually updates the location data in the bucket. This can take several minutes and will either display a success or error message when the json file uploads.

### /check_update
This will return the date and time the bucket was last updated.

### Scheduled Event
The bucket is scheduled to automatically update everyday at noon.


## Roadmap
* Want to add less localized data (meaning more than just Greenville NC)

## CI/CD
Every time a commit is made to main the project will be rebuilt and re-deployed on GCP.
